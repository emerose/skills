# Review, audit & trace — keep the chain honest

Maintains the link between what the experiment *claims* and the data that justifies it, and walks the
`raw → data → analysis → claims` DAG to find where grounding breaks. Three layers: per-artifact
**provenance review**, **staleness/structural audit**, and end-to-end **traceability** (`sci trace`).

> review/audit/check/fingerprint/trace run via `sci` (this skill's CLI); program rollup + drift via
> `skills/scientist/scripts/rollup.py` and `pytest --check-drift` (these fold into `sci` in a later
> stage). `sci trace` ties the provenance DAG and the grounding report together — see "Trace" below.

## Provenance: the one ledger

Each `experiment.yml` holds a unified `provenance` list. Every generation step appends an edge —
`artifact` + its `inputs` (each `path` + `sha256`) — for `data/…` (extract), `analysis/…` (derive),
and `README.md` (review). The inputs list is **explicit and per-file** (not an opaque roll-up), so
drift is inspectable file by file.

## README review & staleness (the prose ↔ data link)

```bash
sci fingerprint K1-000000   # the input files (+ current sha256) review would record now
sci review K1-000000 [--input <repo-rel path>]   # stamp provenance after verifying README vs data
sci audit  [K1-000000] [--json]          # staleness vs recorded provenance + a semantic worklist
```

- **`review`** — run after you've verified the README still matches the data. Records, per artifact
  (the README), each input file with its `sha256`, plus the README's own `sha256` and the date. Inputs
  = the experiment's in-folder data files (everything except a root `README.*` and the sidecar) **plus**
  any external dependency you declare with `--input` (repeatable; e.g. CRO slides under `Shared/`).
  External inputs persist across re-reviews.
- **`audit`** — re-hashes every recorded input + the README and reports `up-to-date`, `stale` (naming
  each input that **changed** / went **missing** / was **added**, and whether the README itself was
  edited since review), `no-provenance` (never reviewed), or `no-/invalid-experiment-yml`. `--json` adds
  a per-experiment `source_files` worklist for the **semantic pass** plus a `prose_docs` list (the
  README + `reports/*.md` whose quantitative results must each map to a grounded claim — see below):
  fan out an agent per experiment to read the data, verify the prose, and run `sci enforce-prose` —
  the authoritative content check (see [auditing.md](auditing.md)).

### Quantitative prose ↔ claims enforcement (`sci enforce-prose`)

The gate that keeps a `README.md` / `reports/*.md` sentence from **asserting a quantitative result
without a grounded `kind=claim` backing it**. Two halves, split by what each is good at:

- **Detection is the agent's job (inverted control).** Judging *whether a sentence asserts a
  quantitative result* is a language task, not a regex one — so `audit` does **not** scan prose. Its
  `prose_docs` list just points the semantic-pass agent at the docs; the agent reads them, decides which
  sentences are quantitative claims (a %, fold-change, p-value, `n=`, dose, IC50…), and passes that list on.
- **Enforcement is deterministic.** The agent feeds its assertions to `sci enforce-prose`, which does the
  part worth pinning down — parse the exact citation, resolve the claim, check the backing:

  ```bash
  sci enforce-prose <exp> [--source <doc>] [--report PATH] [--json]   # assertions as JSON on stdin
  echo '["Knockdown reached 82% [claim:test_kd_lumbar]."]' | sci enforce-prose "K1-000000 - …"
  ```
  Assertions arrive as a JSON list of strings or `{"text", "line"}` objects. Cite a result in prose with
  **`[claim:<id>]`** (the full stable `claim_id` `<exp>::<test-file>::<node>`, or just its trailing node
  name). An assertion is **cleared** only when a citation resolves to a claim that is *grounded*
  (`passed`/`xpass`) **and** *strong/moderate* strength. Otherwise it's flagged:
  - `unbacked` — no `[claim:…]` citation (carries an advisory best-overlap `suggestion`, never an
    auto-clear — a coincidental match must not mask missing evidence);
  - `weak-backing` — cited only to a claim that is contradicted (`xfail`), drifted (`failed`),
    unverifiable (`skipped`), or weak/unspecified — **surfaced with its `outcome`+`strength`**, so prose
    leaning on a contradicted result is caught, not silently passed;
  - `unknown-claim` — a citation that resolves to no known claim.

  Exit is **1 if anything is flagged**, 0 if every assertion maps to a grounded claim (a usable CI gate).
- **Backing source** — `sci enforce-prose` is **store-free** like `sci trace`: it backs the check with
  the experiment's `grounding_report.json` (the source the `kind=claim` index is itself built from;
  `--report` overrides the path). Claims are keyed by the same stable `claim_id` the index uses, so
  `[claim:…]` citations resolve identically.
- **Reusable entry point** — the deterministic core is `scientist.store._prose.enforce_prose(assertions,
  claims)`: pure (no I/O, no store, no regex), free of README- or store-specific plumbing. The planned
  report phase (`sci report`) reuses it verbatim — its generating agent emits the assertions it wrote,
  which enforce against the report's claims.

## Structural check

```bash
sci check [K1-000000] [--json]   # structural integrity; never mutates
```
Flags missing `README.md`/`experiment.yml`, on-disk files not indexed, layout drift, thin metadata,
and **redundant archives** (a zip whose members are already extracted in-folder — the `raw.zip` case).
Emits a worklist.

## Data-extraction audit

The `data/` edges have their own re-extraction audit (determinism, grounding, recipe-sha, data/↔recipe,
reconciliation, naming) plus the full cell-coverage check — see [extract.md](extract.md) (`audit.py`,
`cellcov.py`). Because the data edges live in the same `provenance` list, stock `sci audit` checks them too.

## Claims: grounding report, rollup, drift

Running the pytest claims emits `grounding_report.{md,json}` (per claim: `{id, statement, outcome, kind,
strength, caveats, evidence, inputs+shas, reconcile, drift?}`).

```bash
pytest <…>/analysis/claims --check-drift        # flag stale claims (input changed since @strength set)
SCIENTIST_HOME=… rollup.py [--out DIR] [--no-drift]   # PROGRAM-WIDE rollup
```

- **Program rollup** runs *every* `<exp>/analysis/claims` in one session (so cross-experiment
  `cross()`/`uses()` links resolve) and aggregates into `program_evidence.{md,json}`: counts by
  outcome/kind/strength, a per-experiment table, the **cross-experiment claim graph** (every claim whose
  evidence spans >1 experiment), and the stale-claim list. The substrate for a semantic audit of the
  program's stated conclusions.
- **Drift (`--check-drift`)** — for each claim, finds the commit that last set its `@strength` marker
  (`git blame`) and flags the claim **stale** if any captured input changed since then → re-judge.
- **Temporal ledger = git.** Editing a `@strength` or a statement across commits is a belief change;
  `git blame` + the commit message is the "as-of" rationale. No YAML.

**Claims feed the store.** After running the claims, `sci index-claims <exp>` indexes each claim from the
grounding report into libkit as a `kind=claim` card (statement embedded; outcome + strength + claim kind
as metadata; stale claims pruned), so `sci query "…" --kind claim` surfaces grounded evidence directly —
and never surfaces a contradicted (`xfail`) or weak claim as fact without its status.

## Trace — end-to-end

```bash
sci trace <exp> [--json] [--claim <id>] [--report PATH]   # claim → analysis → data → raw, with breaks
```

`sci trace` walks the one provenance ledger to connect each terminal back to the original measurements —
**claim → analysis artifact(s) → `data/` file(s) → `raw/` source(s)** — and flags every break. It is a
**pure provenance walk: it needs NO libkit store** (reads only `experiment.yml` + an optional
`grounding_report.json`) and never re-runs an analysis (reproduction is out of scope — this is a static
DAG + drift walk).

- **Terminals.** With a grounding report present (default search: `<exp>/analysis/grounding_report.json`,
  then `<exp>/grounding_report.json`; override with `--report`), each *claim* is a terminal and its cited
  `inputs` are its backing. `--claim <id>` traces just one claim (full nodeid or its trailing name). With
  no report, the README + top `analysis/` artifacts are the terminals.
- **Break categories** (each names the offending file):
  - `missing` — a recorded input file is absent on disk;
  - `drifted` — a recorded input's bytes differ from its recorded sha (reuses `staleness`);
  - `unsourced` — a `data/` edge with no `raw/` input, or an `analysis/` edge with no `data/` input;
  - `dangling` — a claim/edge references an artifact or data file that no edge produces and that isn't on disk;
  - `ungrounded` — a claim whose inputs include no `data/` or `analysis/` artifact (a pure assertion).
- **Output.** Human-readable per-terminal chain-to-raw + breaks + an overall **GROUNDED / BROKEN** verdict;
  with `--json`, `{experiment, chains:[{terminal, kind, path_to_raw, breaks}], breaks, status}`. Exit 0 if
  fully grounded, 1 if any break. (Lives in `provenance/trace.py` — provenance-level and store-free.)

## Changes land as reviewable PRs

```bash
sci pr "title" <paths…> [--dry-run]   # branch, commit, push, open a PR for you to review & merge
```
The data folder is a git repo with a private GitHub remote; scientist never writes silently to `main`.
The libkit store (`.scientist/`) is gitignored. `--dry-run` shows the git/gh steps first.

## Maintaining (for agents working ON scientist)

For the periodic correctness/hygiene procedure — structural `check`, deps-staleness `audit`, and the
parallel-agent semantic pass — see [auditing.md](auditing.md).
Keep stateful stores healthy (repo-root AGENTS.md): a fast deterministic pass for structure + a
parallel-agent pass that actually reads the data, both emitting a structured worklist.
